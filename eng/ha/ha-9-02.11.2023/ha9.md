### Task

1. A Genuine Smile: A genuine smile involves not just the muscles around the mouth, but also the eyes. Crow's feet at the eyes and visible teeth can be indicators of a genuine smile, sometimes referred to as a Duchenne smile.

2. Discomfort: Signs of discomfort might include self-soothing behaviors like rubbing hands, touching the neck, or a lack of eye contact. People might also create barriers with objects, cross their arms, or display closed body language.

3. A Conversation That is Going Well: Open body language is a good indicator, such as uncrossed arms and legs, consistent eye contact, and mirroring of postures or gestures. Nodding and leaning in can also show engagement and interest.

4. Lying: Indicators of lying can be complex and varied, but they may include inconsistent facial expressions, avoiding eye contact, covering vulnerable body parts like the throat or face, and providing too much information when it's not necessary.

5. Being Closed Off Mentally, Physically, Emotionally: Closed body language such as crossed arms and legs, turning the body away, or minimal eye contact can suggest that a person is closed off. They may also be less responsive in conversation and may isolate themselves from interaction.

6. Stress: Signs of stress can include shallow breathing, fidgeting, sweating, and speech errors or changes in pitch. Stress may also lead to rapid blinking or difficulty maintaining eye contact.

7. Defensiveness: This can be indicated by crossed arms, a slight body lean away from the perceived threat, or making oneself small. Facial expressions might be tight, and hands may be closed or balled into fists.
