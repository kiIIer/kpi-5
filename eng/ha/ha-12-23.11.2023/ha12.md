### Ex 8/35

**Programming with Rust: System and Application Development**

**AIMS:**

1. To introduce programmers to the Rust programming language.
2. To provide a strong foundation in safe system-level programming.
3. To explore Rust's concurrency model and memory safety guarantees.
4. To develop skills for creating efficient and reliable software applications.
5. To encourage the practical application of Rust in various domains like web development, embedded systems, and command-line tools.

**DESCRIPTION:**
The course is structured in four parts:

**Part 1** - Basics of Rust: Introduction to Rust syntax, data types, ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes. Setting up the development environment and understanding the compilation process.

**Part 2** - Advanced Rust: Delving into advanced topics such as error handling, generics, traits, and concurrency. Understanding the ecosystem and package management with Cargo.

**Part 3** - Rust in Practice: Applying Rust to real-world scenarios including web services with frameworks like Rocket and Actix, and building CLI tools.

**Part 4** - Projects and Performance: Focusing on optimizing Rust applications for performance. Completing a capstone project that incorporates the full range of skills learned throughout the course.

**STAFF:**
PhD. Mike

**METHOD AND FREQUENCY OF CLASS:**
Interactive workshops once a week complemented by weekly coding assignments and group projects. Office hours available for additional support.

**ASSESSMENT:**
Evaluation through a combination of practical programming assignments, a mid-term project, and a final capstone project.
